# hello-world
A legend is born.
Just kidding....
Let me properly introduce myself...I am Suspense.
After clearing JEE-Advanced with flying colours...I am currently in 1st year in the Computer Science Department of IIT Kharagpur.
I have recently stated coding and would like to go a long way....And I do hope that I can rely on you all to overcome all the problems which I face in this journey of mine....Likewise,I would also love to help others in their programmes and all...as much as I can do...... to my full potential.    ;-)
So a very good luck to all of us.
